              <p>Glad to have you on my site. Let me give you a brief about myself. It was back in 2005 when I was first introduced to a computer. I was fascinated by the mysterious box while playing Virtual Cop 2 and Hercules. From then being curious about the magic wand I thought to become the wizard. In 2013 I sailed my ship towards the vast journey of computer science engineering, I started to learn about the witchery of the computer. I am still learning, and I am glad there are so many things still I will get to learn.
                <br><br>
               Besides having boundless passion and love for computing I do love hiking, reading manga or books, watching anime, drama series and sketching as well. 
               Currently, I am working as a python developer(intern). Alongside I am developing my acquired skills by creating different projects. I have a keen interest in system engineering and pen-testing. I hope to acquire certification courses on RHCSA & RHCE in the upcoming days. After that, I wish to diversify my knowledge towards OHCP.
                <br><br>
               This is still an under-construction portfolio site. I hope to update it with various findings as well as learnings on data structures and algorithms, web technologies, and security solutions. Thank you for visiting my site. Have a great time!!!
            </p>
