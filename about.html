            <p>Glad to have you on my site. Let me give you a brief about myself. I have completed my Computer Science and Engineering graduation from Eastern University. I was first fascinated by the magical box
               computer when I first played DX Ball. Till then the vast journey towards an unknown destination my curious ship has been sailling with that magical mast on my hand. 
               Now I like to spend my time researching various algorithms and understanding various methodology behind web technology. 
                <br><br>
               Besides having boundless passion and love for computing I do love hiking, reading comics or books, watching anime, drama series and sketching as well. I also love to ride my bicycle. 
               Currently I am working on my skills and honning already aquired skills by creating different projects. I have a keen interest towards system engineering and pentesting. I have gathered some basic ground knowledge on RHCSA contents via internet research. 
               Hope to acquire certification course on RHCSA in the upcoming time. After that I wish to continue my journey towards CEH. 
                <br><br>
               This is my under construction portfolio site. I hope to update it with various findings as well as learnings on data structures and algorithms, and web related technology solutions. Thanks for visiting my site. Have a great time!!!
