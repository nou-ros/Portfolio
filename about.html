              <p>Glad to have you here. Here is a little brief about me. As a little boy, I was always fascinated by the electronic components which were lying here and there in the house. From there my fascinating journey towards engineering began. It was in 2005 when I get to have a computer for the first time. That abacus could run games like Virtual Cop 2, Hercules, DX ball, and whatnot. Playing around with the box for more than 8 years I sailed my ship in 2013 towards computer science. I started to learn about the witchery of the computer. Till now I can say I am still learning, and I am glad that this journey is a never-ending one. 
                <br><br>
               Besides having boundless passion and love for computing I do love playing around with electronic components as a hobbyist. Also, I love long walks, reading manga or books, watching animes, and drama series during my off time.   
               Recently, I have completed my python software engineer internship. I have been thoroughly interested in various python development areas for a long time. So currently I have been utilizing myself with data science and machine learning studies. Also, I have a keen interest in cybersecurity as well.
                <br><br>
               This is still an under-construction portfolio site. I hope to update it with various findings as well as learnings on data structures and algorithms, web technologies, and computer electronics. Thank you for visiting my site. Have a great time!!!            
               </p>
